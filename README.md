# YouTheme [Live Demo](https://youtheme.herokuapp.com/)

Youtube doesn't offer the possibility to filter your feed. With
a growing list of subscriptions, the experience becomes
inevitably messy.

YouTheme is a youtube subscriptions sorter, which allows you to
create custom feeds based on your own themes.
